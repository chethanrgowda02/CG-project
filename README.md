1. **Imports Libraries**:
   - `cv2` for video capture and display.
   - `mediapipe` for hand landmark detection.
   - `math.hypot` to calculate the distance between points.
   - `screen_brightness_control` to adjust the screen brightness.
   - `numpy` for numerical operations.

2. **Initialize the Hand Detection Model**:
   - Uses MediaPipe's Hands solution to detect hand landmarks. 
   - Sets parameters like `min_detection_confidence`, `min_tracking_confidence`, and `max_num_hands`.

3. **Video Capture**:
   - Starts capturing video from the webcam using OpenCV's `VideoCapture(0)`.

4. **Processing Each Frame**:
   - Converts each frame to RGB format for hand processing.
   - If hands are detected, it extracts the landmarks for each hand.
   - Draws the landmarks on the frame.

5. **Brightness Adjustment**:
   - If landmarks are detected, it calculates the distance between the thumb and index finger.
   - Maps this distance to a brightness level using `numpy.interp`.
   - Sets the screen brightness using `screen_brightness_control`.

6. **Display and Exit**:
   - Displays the processed video frame.
   - Breaks the loop and closes the video window when the 'q' key is pressed.

In essence, this script dynamically adjusts the screen brightness based on the distance between the thumb and index finger detected by the webcam.
